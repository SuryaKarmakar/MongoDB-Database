- you can connect to a database with the "use command" and you can connect to a brand new database by simply typing its name even if this doesn't exist yet, it will be created on the fly once you start inserting data.
- we can switch to a database with the use command though and you can even switch to databases which don't exist yet.

# db.<collection_name>.<command>()
> db.flights.insertOne({})
